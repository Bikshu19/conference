                    The Prakasam Barrage, built across the Krishna River in
                    Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, is both an important irrigation
                    structure and a road bridge. T The original barrage was
                    constructed in 1855 by the British, and the present
                    structure was completed in 1957, named after Tanguturi
                    Prakasam Pantulu, the first Chief Minister of Andhra State.
                    Stretching about 1.2 km in length, it supplies water to
                    nearly 1.2 million acres of farmland in Krishna, Guntur, and
                    surrounding districts. It also forms a beautiful backdrop
